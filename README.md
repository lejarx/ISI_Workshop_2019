# ISI Workshop 2019

It is becoming increasingly common for organizations to collect huge
amounts of data over time, and existing time series analysis tools are
not always suitable to handle the scale and type of data collected. In
this workshop, we will look at some new methods that have been developed
to handle the analysis of large collections of time series.

We will explore feature-based visualizations and interactive
visualizations, in order to explore time series data in high dimensions.
A similar feature-based approach can be used to identify anomalous time
series within a collection of time series. Finally, we will discuss how
fast automatic forecasting algorithms, along with sparse forecast
reconciliation, can allow millions of time series to be forecast in a
relatively short time

## Syllabus

1.  Tidy time series analysis using tsibbles.
2.  Interactive visualization of high-dimensional time series.
3.  A feature-based approach to time series analysis
4.  Automatic forecasting algorithms
5.  Optimal forecast reconciliation
